In this project, the relationship structure/functionality of some bacteria in absorbing sunlight 
and storing energy is studied from a quantum-mechanical standpoint. The code reproduces some of
the results discussed in the paper "Macroscopic coherence as an emergent property in molecular nanotubes"
